this is a simple tool that helped me take all leetcode solved problems to local and then push them to github 

## Installation

1. **Clone the Project:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hamza-ouabiba/leetcode_tool.git
   cd leetcode_tool

2. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Run script:**
    ```bash
    python Scraper.py

When the script is running, a web browser will open for you to authenticate with your LeetCode account. After logging in, press Enter in the console to start scraping the problems.

The script will gather your solved problems, save them into a problems.json file, create folders for each problem, and store the code inside the corresponding folder .
